# English Premier League Player Height
Data analysis of player heights in the English Premier League.

You can get the source data from this [Guardian article](http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/tall-short-it-how-premier-4503094). Warning: the direct link to the .csv is at the bottom of the article and is 
**super** long. I included the .csv in the repo so you don't have to deal with 
the link.  

This repo includes:  

* Source data  
* Folder with figure  
* HTML file rendered from Rmd  
* md file rendered from Rmd  
* Rmd file  
* R file with scripts
